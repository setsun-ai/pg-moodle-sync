**Never miss course materials, deadlines or announcements from Moodle again.**
moodle-sync downloads your course files into tidy folders in the cloud, puts deadlines into your calendar and notifies you on your phone about what's new. It works with any Moodle, on Windows, macOS, Linux or a Raspberry Pi.

```

## Features

- 📂 **Files → folders in the cloud.** Every course is sorted into *Lectures / Exercises / Labs / Projects / Other*. A teacher's replaced file gets updated in place. Works with Google Drive, OneDrive (incl. university Microsoft 365), Dropbox and [70+ more](https://rclone.org), or with no cloud at all.
- 📅 **Deadlines → Google Calendar.** Submitted assignments get ✅ and stop reminding you. Moved deadlines are updated and notified. Classes go into a separate calendar you can hide. Outlook or Apple Calendar can use a subscription link instead.
- 📢 **Announcements and 🎓 grades** from teachers go straight to your phone, including teacher feedback.
- 🔔 **Your choice of channel:** Telegram (with commands like `/deadlines`, `/sync`), Discord, ntfy or e-mail.
- 🧙 **Setup wizard:** finds out how your university logs in (password or SSO) and guides you. `doctor` checks everything.
- 🖥️ **Runs how you want:** double-click when you feel like it, automatically while your computer is on, or 24/7 on a Raspberry Pi.
- 🌍 **English and Polish:** messages, bot and documentation.
- 🔒 **Private and read-only:** your data stays on your computer and your cloud. It never submits or posts anything.

## Quick start

1. Install **Python 3.10+** ([how](docs/en/getting-started.md#1-install-python-310-or-newer)).
2. **Code → Download ZIP** on this page, unpack it.
3. Double-click **`install.bat`** on Windows, or run `bash install.sh` on macOS/Linux, and follow the wizard.

Full walk-through: **[Getting started](docs/en/getting-started.md)**.

## How to run it

| You have... | Do this |
|---|---|
| a laptop, and you sync when you want | double-click `sync.bat` / `./sync.sh` |
| a computer that's on during the day | [automatic sync every 30 min](docs/en/running.md#automatically-on-your-computer) (Windows Task Scheduler / macOS / Linux) |
| a Raspberry Pi or home server | [24/7 every 15 min + Telegram bot](docs/en/raspberry-pi.md) |

## Is this allowed? Is it safe?

- moodle-sync uses the **official Moodle mobile app API** with **your own** account, the same way the Moodle app on your phone does. It only **reads** your data, and it does so politely: a few dozen requests per run, with a user agent that names the project.
- Your **token is a password-equivalent**. It stays in `.env` on your machine and is never logged or uploaded. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Course materials belong to their authors. Keep them in **your private** storage and **don't share the folder publicly**.
- Check your university's IT rules if in doubt. Personal automation of your own account is generally fine; overloading servers or sharing logins is not.
