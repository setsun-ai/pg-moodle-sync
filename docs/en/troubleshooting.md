# Troubleshooting & FAQ

🇵🇱 [Wersja polska](../pl/troubleshooting.md) · [← README](../../README.md)

**Always start with** `python -m moodle_sync doctor`. It checks everything and says what to fix.

## Errors

**`invalidtoken` / "The Moodle token expired or was revoked"**
Get a new one with `python -m moodle_sync token`. On a Raspberry Pi, also restart the bot: `sudo systemctl restart moodle-sync-bot`. See [Token](token.md#when-the-token-stops-working).

**`nopermissiontoviewgrades` in the logs**
That's normal. Many schools hide the gradebook from students. Grades are read from assignments and quizzes instead, so final grades entered only in the gradebook or the student system won't show up.

**"doesn't respond like Moodle with the mobile app enabled"**
- Check the address in a browser.
- Some sites run a separate Moodle per academic year, see [Token](token.md#one-moodle-per-academic-year).
- If it's right, the site has mobile access turned off.

**`invalid_grant` (Google)**
Your Google login expired. Usually the Google Cloud app is still in *Testing* status: [publish it](google-calendar.md#1-google-cloud-project-once-10-min). Then log in again:
- calendar: `python -m moodle_sync calendar --auth`
- Drive: `rclone config reconnect gdrive:`

**Two folders with the same name on Google Drive**
You created the folder by hand, and rclone with `drive.file` can't see it ([why](storage.md#google-drive)). Move the contents over and delete the empty folder.

**Telegram bot doesn't answer**
- Is it running? `journalctl -u moodle-sync-bot -n 30`, or run `python -m moodle_sync bot` yourself.
- `409 Conflict` means the bot also runs on another machine. Stop one of them.
- Notifications work without the bot. Only commands need it.

**Windows: nothing happens in the background**
- Open *Task Scheduler → moodle-sync → History*.
- Look into `logs\sync.log`.
- Did you move the project folder? Run `deploy\windows\schedule.bat` again.

**macOS: `Operation not permitted`**
The project or `DOWNLOAD_DIR` is in Documents, Desktop or Downloads. See [Running → macOS](running.md#macos).

**Raspberry Pi keeps losing Wi-Fi**
Turn off Wi-Fi power saving, see [Raspberry Pi → Robustness](raspberry-pi.md#robustness).

**The first announcement check sends nothing**
That's by design. The first check only remembers existing posts, and so does any forum that starts being watched later. Only newer posts are notified.

## FAQ

**Is this allowed?**
moodle-sync uses the official mobile app API with **your own** account and only reads your data, like the app does, and with fewer requests. Things to keep in mind:
- Your university's IT rules usually forbid sharing your login or overloading servers. Personal automation is generally fine, but if in doubt, check the rules or ask your IT department.
- Course materials are copyrighted by their authors. Keeping them in **your private** cloud is personal use. **Don't make the folder public or share the links.**

**Where is my data?**
Only on your computer and in the cloud **you** chose. No servers of this project exist. Notifications go through the service you picked (e.g. Telegram).

**Can I force a full resync?**
Stop the scheduler and move `state.json` away. Everything is downloaded again. Nothing is duplicated in the cloud (rclone compares size and date) or in the calendar (events have fixed ids).

**I only want new files, not the whole archive.**
Run `python -m moodle_sync download --baseline` once. It marks everything that exists now as done.

**Does it work with my university?**
It works if your Moodle has the mobile app enabled (almost always). It was developed on Moodle 5.1 at Gdańsk University of Technology and uses only standard API functions available since Moodle 3.9.

**Can it submit assignments / post for me?**
No. By design it's read-only.
